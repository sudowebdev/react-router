# Redirects (Auth)

#### For the following case:

    PrivateRoute = ( {component: Component, ...rest} )

## Destructuring

### Assigning to new variable names

*A property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property.*

    var o = {p: 42, q: true};
    var {p: foo, q: bar} = o;

    console.log(foo); // 42
    console.log(bar); // true
